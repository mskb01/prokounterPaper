# R code for Prokounter paper

This resource presents code used for analysis for the Prokounter manuscript. 

The *src/* folder provides some utility functions. 
The rest of the code is organized into the following files.

 - `Paper_AmplificationSequencing*Rmd` presents code used in modeling amplification and sequencing processes. 

 - `Paper_SSandLoessTrends.Rmd` presents within-genus taxa accumulation data trends. 
 - `Paper_GenusEffectsWhenTesting*Rmd` presents code to characterize systematic genus effects when fitting overall within-genus taxa accumulation data. 
 - `Paper_WGTACsLinearSDtermsAls*Rmd` presents code to compute main text and supplementary tables. 
 - `Paper_AsymptoticAndObservedRichness*Rmd`, `Paper_Chao1CC16Behavior.Rmd`, `Paper_undetectedRichness.Rmd` presents code used for characterizing various richness estimators, their correlations to observed richness estimators and the behavior of undetected richness estimates. 
- `Paper_FoldChangeDistributionTec*Rmd` presents code to characterize the relative abundance fold change distribution across study samples. 
- `Paper_Simulations.Rmd` presents code on simulating differential richness.
